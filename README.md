# create-react-app-brunch
Create simple configurable React apps with a Brunch-based CLI.

## Origins

Born out of [an attempt](https://github.com/brunch/brunch/issues/1466) to convert the [create-react-app project](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) from Webpack to [Brunch](https://github.com/brunch/brunch), several members of the community decided to try to wrap Brunch's React Skeleton into a CLI tool.

The goal is to offer a tool that will allow developers of all levels to start working with a highly configurable, yet simple to understand React app with the least effort.

## Contributing

To get started with contributing:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Run `npm install` inside the project directory.
3. Run `npm link` so you can use the CLI tool on your system.
4. Now you are free to use the CLI tool as you develop it.
